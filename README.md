# MMAPS Frontend

This repository contains the React front-end built with Vite.

The application displays a 3D globe where you can add markers by clicking on the globe. Each marker stores coordinates, a title, a description and an optional image. To start the development server run:

```bash
cd front
npm install
npm run dev
```
